# nice-plug-slint Architecture

This document explains how the Slint/baseview bridge works. Most users won't need to read this, but it's useful if you're debugging something weird or want to contribute.

## Overview

nice-plug's `Editor` trait requires implementing `spawn()`, which is called by the host to open the plugin window. We use baseview for the actual OS window, and Slint's FemtoVG renderer (OpenGL) for drawing the UI.

The tricky parts are:

1. Slint needs to be told which platform/renderer to use, and it can only be set once per process
2. The OpenGL context doesn't exist until baseview creates the window, but Slint may try to create the renderer earlier
3. Window close/reopen cycles need to work correctly

## Components

### `SlintEditor<T>`

The public-facing struct that implements `Editor`. It holds the state, component factory and the event loop handler. Nothing interesting happens here until `spawn()` is called.

### `WindowHandler<T>`

Created inside `spawn()` and passed to baseview. This is where the actual work happens - it implements baseview's `WindowHandler` trait and receives `on_frame()` and `on_event()` calls. It keeps the baseview `WindowContext` so handlers can access the GL context and window geometry.

### `BaseviewSlintAdapter`

Implements `slint::platform::WindowAdapter`. Slint calls this to get the window size and renderer. The renderer is lazily initialized (stored in a `OnceCell`) because it can only be created once the GL context is current.

### `BaseviewSlintPlatform`

Implements `slint::platform::Platform`. Slint calls `create_window_adapter()` on this when a new component is created. We set this once globally and use a thread-local (`CURRENT_ADAPTER`) to return the right adapter for the current window.

### `BaseviewOpenGLInterface`

Implements `slint::platform::femtovg_renderer::OpenGLInterface`. Mostly no-ops since baseview handles context management - the only real implementation is `get_proc_address`, which delegates to `baseview::gl::GlContext::get_proc_address`.

## How window open/close/reopen works

When `spawn()` is called:

1. We create a `BaseviewSlintAdapter` and store it in `CURRENT_ADAPTER`
2. We call `slint::platform::set_platform()` - this only takes effect the first time; subsequent calls are silently ignored by Slint
3. When Slint creates the component and calls `create_window_adapter()`, it gets the adapter we just stored

When the window is closed, the `WindowHandler` is dropped. When it's reopened, `spawn()` is called again and we store a new adapter in `CURRENT_ADAPTER`. Since the platform is already set, `create_window_adapter()` just picks up the new adapter from thread-local storage.

## GL context and renderer initialization

We can't create the FemtoVG renderer until the GL context is current, but Slint wants to call `renderer()` during component initialization. The fix is:

1. Make the GL context current before creating the component (done in `spawn()`)
2. Store the `GlContext` directly in the adapter's `BaseviewOpenGLInterface`, which forwards `ensure_current`, `swap_buffers` and `get_proc_address` to baseview's context
3. The renderer is created lazily in `WindowAdapter::renderer()` using that interface; every render pass re-ensures the context through the same interface

## State persistence

`SlintEditorState` is stored in the plugin's params struct under `#[persist]`, which means nice-plug/the host handles serialization. We update the logical size through the `Arc` when baseview reports a resize.

## Resize handling

The host controls the plugin window frame. This version does not implement programmatic resizing from inside the UI; size changes arrive only from the host via baseview's `resized()` callback, which syncs the physical size, scale factor and persisted logical size.

## Keyboard events

All keyboard events are dispatched to the Slint application and passed to the plugin host by default. You can block propagation to the host when needed - for example, text input components need to capture key events so the host's keyboard shortcuts don't fire while the user is typing.

To control propagation, add a property to your Slint component and toggle it when you need exclusive key input:

```slint
export component AppWindow inherits Window {
    in-out property <bool> prevent_key_event_propagation: bool;
}
```

In the `.with_event_loop` handler, sync this property to `set_prevent_key_event_propagation` on the handler. When `true`, key events are returned as `Captured` (host doesn't see them); when `false`, they're returned as `Ignored` (host sees them too).

```rust
fn editor(&mut self, _async_executor: AsyncExecutor<Self>) -> Option<Box<dyn Editor>> {
    Some(Box::new(
        SlintEditor::new(self.params.editor_state.clone(), || gui::AppWindow::new())
            .with_event_loop({
                move |handler, _setter, _window_context| {
                    handler.set_prevent_key_event_propagation(
                        handler.component().get_prevent_key_event_propagation(),
                    );
                }
            }),
    ))
}
```

Set `prevent_key_event_propagation` back to false once the component no longer needs exclusive key input.

## Data flow

**Plugin → UI:** Read parameter values in the `with_event_loop` handler and push them to Slint component properties each frame.

**UI → Plugin:** Register Slint callbacks (e.g. `component.on_gain_changed(...)`) using `with_setup`. This runs once when the window first opens, before the event loop starts. Prefer this over registering callbacks in `with_event_loop`, since re-registering every frame is wasteful even if harmless.
